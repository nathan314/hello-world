# hello-world
Just a new repository for general learning purposes

Hi terraquians!
Nathan314 here (Natã da Silva Targina, 32, from Brazil), I'm a Digital Designer (Web and Graphic) by degree, and I'm just trying to ressurect my professinal life around São Paulo's area. For this sake, I choosed to start learning Sass coding and Bootstrap framework, even considering try get familiar with Ruby on Rails, as I'm already understood that it's the essential code for compile Bootstrap based front-ent projects. So I may dig this hole ultil the end, maybe to become a good and fully active front-end development professional.
To be honest, all I have done these days are just messing around Youtube to learn from the best video tutorials, and that's how I got here on GitHub to make my first repository and etc.

By the way, if you're interesded in my CV and portfolio, get access to my website http://www.portnathan.com.br/.
Feel free to ask me for job participation and/or commissions.

That's it!
Thanks in advance for everyone coming to help me, and for all the community of such amazing GitHub platform.
May the Force be with every kind and humble souls! :)
